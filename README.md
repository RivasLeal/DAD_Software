# Welcome to the Data Acquisition Device (DAD) Project

## DAD is built to work in conjunction with Kit Integrated Device (KID) which is a custom PCB that is designed to collect EMG signals and send them to the DAD


The DAD is a software that is currently capable of:

1) Adding Multiple Bluetooth Devices
2) Removing Multiple Bluetooth Devices
3) Sending Messages to specified Devices
4) Toggling the state of transmission for each KID
5) Allowing Data recording to be saved as a CSV in a specified location
6) Plot the signal of the incoming data of one of the devices at a time

DAD additions in Development:

1) Plot the signal of the incoming data of multiple devices at a time
2) Plot the signals of the incoming data of all devices on a single graph at the main menu
